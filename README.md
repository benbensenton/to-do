# to-do

- streamplotter module, probably back to pyqt graph as module in jupyterlab (https://gist.github.com/iverasp/9349dffa42aeffb32e48a0868edfa32d ,                                                                                                                  https://pyqtgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ,                                                                                                                                      https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/blob/2.4.0/examples/app/ohlc/main.py ,
                                                                             https://www.numpyninja.com/post/hdf5-file-format-with-pandas)
        - since pyqt as app not flexible enough
        - bokeh is pretty and convienent but not fast enough   
        - matplotlib to slow
        - plotly no streaming
        - hadoop/pyspark/zeromq/dask/vaex/ray/modin/pyarrow/pystore currently overkill 
        - https://github.com/ray-project/ray

- ticker symbol list generator script
- options, future, etc
- av querry for universe us, lon, .fra


- minute download function integration in bs app
        - combined with imediate hdf5 writting and csv deletion as option


- kalmann on historic as initial start with streamplotter
